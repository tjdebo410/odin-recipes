        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Pre-heat your oven to 350F. While that is going on chop your veggies.</p>
                <p>Make sure to wash your fish well and pat dry. Lightly brush olive oil on the fish and veggies.</p>
                <p>Once the oven is ready, put half an inch of water in the bottom of a 9x6 pan, cover with foil, and place fish and veggies.</p>
                <p>Make sure not to crowd the fish with veggies.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>In a small whisk together soy sauce, lemon zest, and veggies.</p>

            <li>
                <p>Cook for 10-12 minutes depending on your oven.</p>
                <p>Once the fish has had a minute or two to cool you can brush your lemon sauce.</p>
                <p>At this point you can garnish with parsley if desired.</p>
